# Mercadito

Creation of an ecommerce website from scratch using:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript Library for building user interfaces
* [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for server side rendered applications 
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - GraphQL is a query language for APIs 
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) - A platform for providing a communication layer that seamlessly connects application clients to back-end services.

Used external services:
* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) - image hosting
* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - Database ORM / GraphQL Server
* [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) - SMTP server for email testing
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - Service for online payments. To make testing transaction you can use the following [card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards)

#### Notes
To avoid creating a search component from scratch, I used [Downshift](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift), which was a nice and accessible solution.

This is the project for the [Advanced React & GraphQL](https://AdvancedReact.com) course by [Wes Bos](https://WesBos.com/).
